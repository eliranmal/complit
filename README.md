# complit

> a neat, lit, auto-complete component

## what

this is an auto-complete web-component, built with [lit][lit-website].


## where

[here][complit-githubio].


## why

this is part of my job application process at [folloze][folloze-website].


## how

to run locally make sure you have [node.js][node-js-website] installed, clone the repository, and in the project root, run:

    npm i
    npm start

this will spawn a typescript builder, a rollup bundler, and a local static server, all on watch mode, waiting for file changes.
when all is set, the application can be found locally at localhost:3000.
at the moment there are no hot-reload capabilities, so you'll have to manually reload the page after changes.
